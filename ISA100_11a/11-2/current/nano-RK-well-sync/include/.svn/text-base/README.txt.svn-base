This directory contains common makefiles used by projects.

Unlike most operating systems that can simply link precompiled libraries
with your application, Nano-RK will need to recompile many kernel files 
each time you change kernel parameters.  These specific compile
time changes allow for a more compact kernel, but have the following
side effects:

   1) Remember to make clean when you switch projects!
   2) Remember to make clean when you change kernel specific #defines
	-for example stack size, buffered uarts, different link layers etc
